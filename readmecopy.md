# 02 Advanced CSS: Portfolio

Description: In this portfolio I created an html page linked to a css stylesheet to display my current working web development portfolio. The site displays a header up top with navigation links to different portions of the page such as contact, works, and an about me section. All works are displayed on the front page with background images and deployable links to those specific works. CSS formatting was created to focus on my primary work first and preceding works later. Contact informational links are deployable from the site itself.
